# EndPointCreator - Android

It is a utility project to configure/update base URL of an application.
User can get EndPointCreator_v1.0.2.arr from this app build folder.

By adding this library you can construct a new EndPoint and it can be received in called Activity by onActivityResult.


@Note - Its just a initial stage of implementation more support to come.

Forks and suggestions are welcome.
